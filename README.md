# FNFU3D
 Friday Night Funkin' developed within Unity

 Due to the recent Unity Pricing changes, I refuse to work on this project.
 The base game is there, though. The whole gameplay is pretty much there so you could fork this and work on whatever you want for yourself.

 Open-Source with immaculately written code (the game crashes after 5 minutes of running)
